Fish Species Recognition Model
Fish Species Recognition

Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model for fish species recognition. The model is trained to classify fish species based on images provided in the dataset. The project aims to help researchers, environmentalists, and fisheries authorities identify various fish species accurately and efficiently.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found in the data directory. It consists of labeled images of different fish species, carefully curated and annotated for training the model. The dataset includes images from various angles and lighting conditions to improve the model's robustness.

Model Architecture
The deep learning model is implemented using the TensorFlow framework with Keras as the high-level API. The model architecture is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract meaningful features from the fish images. The CNN is then followed by fully connected layers to perform the classification task.

Requirements
Python 3.7 or later
TensorFlow 2.5 or later
NumPy
Matplotlib

Results
The model's performance on the test dataset is evaluated using accuracy and other relevant metrics. The results are displayed after running the evaluation script.
